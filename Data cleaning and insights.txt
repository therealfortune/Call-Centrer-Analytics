How do we handle the cast_score null values?
1. Use mean, median or mode?
2. Convert to zero?

We will be using mode because CSAT scores contains categorical values
We will be also be using mode alongside sentiments
So we will get the mode value for each sentiment

Checked for outliers in the numeric columns
