# Call-Centrer-Analytics

This is a data analytics project that involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a fabricated call center dataset from data.world. The dataset CSV file is attached and can be accessed at the following link: https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv

The analytics process involved several steps:

The data was imported into a SQL Server database.
Data exploration was conducted, and a data dictionary was created since one did not exist.
Data cleaning was carried out, which involved converting the ID column to a primary key, filling the null values in the csat_scores column with the mode per sentiment, and checking for outliers and data types for each column.
The analytical phase involved creating a rough work for insights after reviewing the data and writing SQL codes to obtain data on the insights.
In the visualization phase, a dashboard was created in Tableau to display the insights, and the values obtained were crosschecked with the SQL results.
